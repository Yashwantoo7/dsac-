fermat's little theorem states  that if p is prime number, then for any integer a, the number a**p-a is an integer
multiple of p.
a**p == a(modp)

if a is not divisible by p, fermat's little theorem is equivalent to the statement that a**(p-1)-1 is an
integer multiple of p
a**(p-1) == 1(modp)

application
modulo inverse using fermat's theorem

a**p = a(modp)
if a is not divisible by p,
a**(p-1) == 1(modp)
multiplying both sides by a**(-1)
a**(p-2) == a**(-1)(modp)

evaluating (a/b)%m = ((a%m)*(b**(-1)%m))%m

evaluating (nCr)%p

if p>n 
1. pre calculate factorials taking modulo p.
2. nCr%p = (fac[n]*modInverse(fac[r])%p*modInverse(fac[n-r])%p)%p

Wilson's Theorem

A positive integer n>1 is a prime if and only if 
(n-1)! == -1(modn)
or 
(n-1)! == (n-1)(modn)
In other words, (n-1)! is 1 less than a multiple of n.
For example, since we know that 101 is a prime, we can conclude immediately that 100! = 101K-1 for some integer k.
example
calculte(25!%29)
from wilson's theorem, we know that 28! is -1(modp). so we
basically need to find
[(-1)*inverse(28,29)*inverse(27,29)*inverse(26,29)]%29
